To onboard a datasource in Trino, a management team can follow a structured approach, breaking down the task into clear, manageable steps. Here’s a step-by-step guide for a management team to handle this process:

### Step-by-Step Management Workflow

1. **Planning and Preparation**
   - **Define Objectives:**
     - Determine the purpose of onboarding the datasource (e.g., analytics, reporting).
     - Identify the specific datasource to be integrated (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - **Allocate Resources:**
     - Assign a project manager or a lead for the onboarding process.
     - Identify team members responsible for each task (e.g., system admin, database admin, developers).
   - **Set Timeline:**
     - Define a project timeline with key milestones and deadlines.

2. **Environment Setup**
   - **Install Trino:**
     - Ensure Trino is installed and running on the server.
     - Verify the installation by running a simple query on an existing datasource.
   - **Identify Connector:**
     - Determine the appropriate Trino connector for the datasource.
     - Verify compatibility and requirements (e.g., JDBC driver version).

3. **Configuration Preparation**
   - **Create Catalog Configuration File:**
     - Draft the configuration file (`<catalog-name>.properties`) with the necessary details.
   - **Review Configuration Details:**
     - Verify the connection details (e.g., URL, username, password) with the database administrator.

4. **Technical Setup**
   - **Download and Place JDBC Driver:**
     - Download the JDBC driver for the datasource.
     - Place the driver in the correct Trino plugin directory (`plugin/<connector-name>`).
   - **Edit Configuration File:**
     - Complete and review the properties file.
     - Ensure correct syntax and parameters.

5. **Deployment**
   - **Start Trino Server:**

       Onboarding a datasource in Trino involves several steps, including configuring the catalog properties, setting up the connection to the datasource, and ensuring that the appropriate drivers and connectors are in place. Here’s a detailed guide to help you through the process:

### Step 1: Install Trino
Ensure you have Trino installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Trino website](https://trino.io/download.html). Follow the installation instructions provided there.

### Step 2: Identify and Download the Connector
Trino supports various data sources through connectors. Identify the connector needed for your datasource. For instance:
- For MySQL: `mysql`
- For PostgreSQL: `postgresql`
- For Hive: `hive`
- For Oracle: `oracle`

You can find a complete list of supported connectors in the [Trino documentation](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector.html).

### Step 3: Configure the Catalog Properties
Each datasource requires a catalog configuration file in the `etc/catalog` directory of your Trino installation. This file defines the connection details and properties for the datasource.

1. **Create the Catalog File:**
   Create a properties file named `<catalog-name>.properties` (e.g., `mysql.properties`) in the `etc/catalog` directory.

2. **Edit the Catalog File:**
   Add the necessary configuration properties to the file. Here’s an example for a MySQL datasource:

   ```properties
   connector.name=mysql
   connection-url=jdbc:mysql://<host>:<port>/<database>
   connection-user=<username>
   connection-password=<password>
   ```

   Replace `<host>`, `<port>`, `<database>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with your MySQL server details.

### Step 4: Ensure the JDBC Driver is Available
Ensure the JDBC driver for your datasource is available in the Trino plugin directory (`plugin/<connector-name>`).

1. **Download the JDBC Driver:**
   Download the JDBC driver for your datasource. For MySQL, it can be found at [MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).

2. **Place the Driver:**
   Place the downloaded JDBC driver jar file in the `plugin/<connector-name>` directory. For MySQL, it would be `plugin/mysql`.

### Step 5: Start Trino Server
Start the Trino server if it’s not already running. Use the following command:

```sh
bin/launcher start
```

### Step 6: Verify the Connection
Once the server is running, you can verify the connection to your datasource.

1. **Open Trino CLI:**
   Start the Trino CLI using the following command:

   ```sh
   bin/trino
   ```

2. **Run a Query:**
   Run a simple query to verify the connection. For example, to list tables in a MySQL database:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES FROM <catalog-name>.information_schema.tables;
   ```

Replace `<catalog-name>` with the name of your catalog (e.g., `mysql`).

### Example: Onboarding MySQL Datasource

1. **Create the Catalog File:**

   `etc/catalog/mysql.properties`:
   ```properties
   connector.name=mysql
   connection-url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
   connection-user=myuser
   connection-password=mypassword
   ```

2. **Download and Place the JDBC Driver:**
   Download the MySQL JDBC driver and place it in the `plugin/mysql` directory.

3. **Start the Trino Server:**
   ```sh
   bin/launcher start
   ```

4. **Verify the Connection:**
   ```sh
   bin/trino
   SHOW TABLES FROM mysql.information_schema.tables;
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to onboard a datasource in Trino. Each datasource will have its specific requirements, so refer to the Trino documentation for any datasource-specific configurations.
